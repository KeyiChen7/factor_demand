    "- The paper specifies that it utilized only \"US domestic equity\" funds, so we need to identify this information. \n",
    "- Through various trials and errors, I found out that the best way to achieve this filter is through the `crsp.fund_style` table's `crsp_obj_cd` column. (https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/data-dictionary/crsp_q_mutualfunds/fund_style/)\n",
    "- I left join these two tables above. \n",

    "## Obtaining `wficn`\n",
    "- I discovered that **each mutual fund can have multiple `crsp_fund_no`**, representing different _share classes_. \n",

    "- The author describes the algorithm to perform this aggregation in **footnote 4**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Multiple `wficn` for each `crsp_fundno`\n",
    "- As explained above, it's very common for one `wficn` to match with multiple `crsp_fundno`, because the latter represents a specific share class of a fund. \n",
    "- However, I discovered rare occurrances where one `crsp_fundno` matches with multiple `wficn`. This is unexpected, since each `wficn` should conceptually represents one \"institution\" or \"fund\". \n",
    "- I could not figure out the underlying reasons, but suspect that it could have something to do with delisting / merging of funds. For instance, one fund could be fully aqcuired by another fund, and thus assumed two fund identifiers. "
